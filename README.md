# Rental Housing Price in New York City

This analysis was conducted for UW - Madison CS 320 final project. In this final project, I was required to use two methods to
conduct the analysis with `supervised` and `unsupervised learning` method.

The first method that I used for the `unsupervised learning` was the `Principal Component Analysis` in order to do clustering to show
how apartments in New York are divided by the borough. The figure below shows the result of the graph.

The second method that I used for the `supervised learning` was the `Multiple Linear Regression` in order to do prediction of the housing in New York city for foreigners. The figure below shows the result of the graph.
