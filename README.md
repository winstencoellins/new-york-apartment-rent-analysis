# Rental Housing Price in New York City
  New York, one of the most popular cities in the United States has attracted many tourists from
many countries in the world for decades because of its places of interest. Tourists have been spending their
day and night wandering around New York to fully experience the atmosphere where they would never
regret in their lives. Besides enjoying the atmosphere, tourists often decide regarding how much spending
per day they will need to get the estimation of spending they need to. Thus, my motivation for this project
is to help tourists to decide for their spending so that tourists can estimate their spending while enjoying
their vacation.
  The source of data is taken from New York Cityâ€™s leading real estate marketplace called StreetEasy
- https://github.com/Codecademy/datasets/tree/master/streeteasy. Taking three datasets which are
manhattan.csv, queens.csv, and brooklyn.csv. I then concatenate the data and merge them into one file
called data.csv. Therefore, I have three borough of New York City which are Manhattan, Queens, and
Brooklyn for analysis.
  For the analysis, I selected 12 of the 18 features from the data. I selected the number of bedrooms,
number of bathrooms, size square feet of the rental property, minutes to subway, number of floors, building
age, fee, roof deck, washer dryer, doorman, elevator, dishwasher, patio, and gym.
  Figure One shows the average rent of each borough in New York City. From the visualization, it
shows that the most expensive borough in New York City is Manhattan averaging US$5138.94, follow up
by Brooklyn averaging US$3327.40, and Queens averaging US$2516.14. As an addition, from the analysis
I have, the total rental housing properties provided in each borough are different with the statistics:
Manhattan (70.78%), Brooklyn (20.26%), Queens (8.96%). Thus, the most rental housing properties
provided are in Manhattan with high price, second is Brooklyn with a middle-class price, and Queens with
the cheapest price in New York City.
  Figure Two shows the Principal Components 1 and Principal Components 2. The method I used
here is the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to do dimensionality reduction from 15 features into two
dimensions to enable the visualization. From the clusters, I have to say that Manhattan has a variety type
of properties that has features that are almost similar to Queens and Brooklyn since the clusters distribution
almost has no specific cluster or area at all for Manhattan. As an addition, the explained variance ratio from
the Principal Components Analysis is 99.22% and 0.752%.
Figure Three shows the correlation of the actual price versus the predicted price from the model by
using Multiple Linear Regression. The accuracy of the training model compared to testing set was 72.81%
with the coefficients: -447.67 (number of bedroom), 1324.27 (number of bathrooms), 4.67 (size of the
property in square feet), -18.57 (minutes to subway), 39.19 (number of floors), -4.3 (building age), -83.34
(fee), 66.9 (roof deck), 225.44 (washer dryer), -95.92 (doorman), 217.16 (elevator), 42.17 (dishwasher), -
38.8 (patio), and 22.47 (gym). I then try to increase the accuracy of the model by using Standard Scaler and
Polynomial Features, and the accuracy of the model goes up by 2%.
  In conclusion, we have discovered that to visit New York City, one does not need to spend a huge
amount of money to stay since New York is famous of its luxury. Moreover, from the analysis, we could
use the Linear Regression model to estimate the spending that one will need to help manage the expenses.
Overall, these models may be helpful for tourists to predict their expenses to enjoy the beauty of New York
City.
